Introduce the problem, relevance, and general problem with HD estimation. 

Variable selection - we eliminate half the sample countries immediately. Perhaps check which countries are left, these could be similar - selection bias? This also eliminates all variables that are not available for all the 102 countries. 

We select variables based on Lasso i presume. We can try different penalty terms. 

How do we test the null of beta being negative? Alpha inference :) 

Overall pointers: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Much less math, more economic intuition i.e. explain why certain assumptions might or might not hold economically. 
    \item More structure. 
    \item Short, and PRECISE. 
    \item Adhere to formal requirements; margins, font size, linespacing, tables at the end... 
\end{enumerate}
